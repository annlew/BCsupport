Finding information about CMIP
----------------

CMIP page can be found `here <https://wcrp-cmip.org/>`_
 
Finding the data - ESGF
----------------

**Today's task:**

Find: 

* monthly mean 
* near surface teperature for 
* year 2000 from 
* historical experiment from 
* three different models

ESGF is `here <https://esgf.llnl.gov/>`_ 

**Together:**

* Start with NorESM.

| The CMIP6 data request 
| https://clipc-services.ceda.ac.uk/dreq/index.html

| CMIP global attributes and Controlled Vocabulary (CV)
| https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h0r8RZr_f3-8egBMMh7aqLwy3snpD6_MrDz1q8n5XUk/edit?tab=t.0

What is variant label/id, e.g. r1i1p1f1?

* Then, continue with EC-Earth.

| Some example scripts can be found here:

| A look at the NetCDF file format

The CF (Climate and Forecast) convention

**Your task:**

* Your model of choice. Access montly mean near surface temperature for year 2000 from a historical simulation from a model that is not NorESM or EC-Earth.
